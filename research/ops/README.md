# Operations on the VPS

Everything Pythia runs on the lab machine, and when. All times UTC.

| When | What | Where |
|---|---|---|
| always | market data recorder | container `pythia-recorder` (`research/recorder`) |
| always | headless engine: lab book, volatility model in shadow mode, `/api/lab` | container `pythia-server` on 127.0.0.1:8787 only |
| always | a second engine for autopilots, kept apart so they never touch the lab book's markets or evidence; state in `/srv/pythia-data/autopilot` | container `pythia-autopilot` on 127.0.0.1:8788 only |
| 03:30 | history backfill: 20 lab coins, every USDT pair, every USDT perp | `/etc/cron.d/pythia-backfill` |
| 04:00 | momentum paper books, engine signals, paper vs backtest review | `/etc/cron.d/pythia-paper` |
| 04:15 | sweep candidates as paper books: survivorship-free momentum (daily, and in seven weekly tranches), Donchian breakout (about 10 minutes, rebuilds the daily panel into `/srv/pythia-data/lab-cache`) | `/etc/cron.d/pythia-paper-families` |
| 04:45 | M4 shadow paper book, market-neutral on perps (`lab.paper.m4_ls`, 2 to 3 minutes, about 3 GB; rebuilds the xs_daily panel and retrains weekly into `/srv/pythia-data/lab-cache`) | `/etc/cron.d/pythia-paper-m4` |
| 05:30 | market-neutral M2 paper books (v1 and v2) | `/etc/cron.d/pythia-paper-ls` |
| 06:15 | forward report: every paper book and autopilot against its backtest (`lab.paper.forward_report`, seconds) | `/etc/cron.d/pythia-forward` |
| 06:30 | learning loop: demo-fill costs, forward evidence, monthly sweep refresh, weekly vol and monthly M2 retrain as challengers, nightly digest (`lab.ops.learn`, seconds; up to a few hours when a retrain is due) | `/etc/cron.d/pythia-learn` |
| Sun 05:40 | cost calibration from the recorded books, report only | `/etc/cron.d/pythia-costs` |
| 05:00 | strategy factory, forward shadow step: appends the new days to each shadow book, decides those with 30 days (`lab.factory shadow`, seconds) | `/etc/cron.d/pythia-factory` |
| Sun 07:30 | strategy factory, weekly run: 300 new genomes in sample, six held-back checks, shadow review, report and digest (`lab.factory`, about a minute) | `/etc/cron.d/pythia-factory` |
| after the learning loop | daily digest to the operator's webhook (`lab.ops.notify`, seconds) | `/etc/cron.d/pythia-learn` |
| every 15 min | trending watcher: DexScreener boosted tokens, Binance gainers and volume surges, surge alerts on coins Alpaca lists, a daily on-chain hype digest from 08:00 (`lab.ops.trending`, seconds; reads only) | `/etc/cron.d/pythia-trending` |
| hourly :07 | health check of all of the above; posts when not ok two runs in a row | `/etc/cron.d/pythia-health` |

## Health check

`system_health.sh` looks at the containers, the recorder's streams, the last
backfill, each paper book's last row, the model service and the engine's
market data (`dataHealth` in `/api/state`), and writes
`/srv/pythia-data/_health/system.json`. It never restarts anything. The Lab
page shows it ("Is everything running?"); the PC gets it with the sync.

Install or update:

```bash
scp research/ops/system_health.sh pythia-vps:/tmp/ && ssh pythia-vps 'install -m 755 /tmp/system_health.sh /opt/pythia-ops/system_health.sh'
```

## Forward report

`lab.paper.forward_report` reads the paper journals and the autopilot
engine's `/api/state` and writes `/srv/pythia-data/reports/forward/`
(`latest.json`, `latest.md`, dated copies). Both engines mount the reports
read-only, so the Lab page of either shows it as "Forward test". The
container needs the host network to reach the autopilot engine on
127.0.0.1:8788; if the engine is down the report says so and still covers the
paper books. `/etc/cron.d/pythia-forward`:

```cron
# Pythia: daily forward report, paper books and autopilots against their backtests. Reads only.
15 6 * * * root docker run --rm --network host --memory 2g -v /srv/pythia-data:/data -v /opt/pythia-lab:/app pythia-lab python -m lab.paper.forward_report >> /var/log/pythia-forward.log 2>&1
```

The bands come from the backtests' out-of-sample daily returns in
`reports/forward/backtest/<book>.json`. The momentum books can be exported on
the VPS itself; the sweep candidates and M4 need the sweep's run caches and
the xs_daily pick cache (the tranche book is re-simulated on the sweep's cached
panel), which live where those experiments ran, so their files are exported
there and copied over:

```bash
docker run --rm --memory 4g -v /srv/pythia-data:/data -v /opt/pythia-lab:/app pythia-lab python -m lab.paper.forward_report --export-backtests
scp <exported>/forward/backtest/*.json pythia-vps:/srv/pythia-data/reports/forward/backtest/
```

Re-export after an experiment is re-run. Books without a file fall back to an
approximate band from their report (growth and volatility), marked as such.

## Strategy factory

`lab.factory` (see "Strategy factory" in `research/lab/README.md`) searches a
fixed budget of new long-only strategies on the in-sample window, counts each
one in `/srv/pythia-data/factory/ledger.jsonl` (a ledger that only grows, on
top of the 377 hand-study trials), sends six a week to the held-back window,
and runs the survivors 30 days as forward shadow books before anything can
become a paper book. It reads the daily panel the paper-families job caches in
`/srv/pythia-data/lab-cache`, so it runs after 04:15. It writes only
`/srv/pythia-data/factory/` and `/srv/pythia-data/reports/factory/`; a
promoted genome is listed in `factory/promoted.json`, which the paper-families
job steps as one more paper book. It has no way to reach the engines, live
settings or money. With `--notify` the weekly digest (what was tried, what
survived the held-back window and why, the shadow books) goes to the webhook or
Telegram chat in `/etc/pythia/alerts.env`; the daily step posts only when a
shadow book is decided.

The first run was made on the PC; its trials and its shadow book are in
`research/lab/results/factory_seed/`, which every run merges into
`/srv/pythia-data/factory/` first (only what is missing). `/opt/pythia-lab`
must carry that folder, as it carries the rest of `research/lab`.

`/etc/cron.d/pythia-factory`:

```cron
# Pythia: strategy factory. Daily forward shadow step, weekly search and held-back checks with a digest. Paper only; never touches live settings or money.
0 5 * * * root docker run --rm --memory 2g --env-file /etc/pythia/alerts.env -v /srv/pythia-data:/data -v /opt/pythia-lab:/app -e PYTHIA_AGENT_OUT=/data/lab-cache pythia-lab python -m lab.factory shadow --notify >> /var/log/pythia-factory.log 2>&1
30 7 * * 0 root docker run --rm --cpus 4 --memory 4g --env-file /etc/pythia/alerts.env -v /srv/pythia-data:/data -v /opt/pythia-lab:/app -e PYTHIA_AGENT_OUT=/data/lab-cache pythia-lab python -m lab.factory --notify >> /var/log/pythia-factory.log 2>&1
```

A larger or smaller week: `--budget N`. See the last digest without posting:

```bash
docker run --rm -v /srv/pythia-data:/data -v /opt/pythia-lab:/app pythia-lab python -m lab.factory digest --dry-run
```

## Learning loop

`lab.ops.learn` runs every night after the forward report and keeps the
system improving on its own, inside fixed bounds. Each step is isolated; a
failing one is named in the digest and the rest still run.

| Step | When | What it does | Writes |
|---|---|---|---|
| costs | nightly | reads the autopilot engine's orders (`GET /api/state`, or `PYTHIA_LEARN_ORDERS_FILE`), keeps the finished demo orders of the Alpaca paper account in a ledger that only grows, measures per symbol realised against modelled and base-table slippage and the maker (limit) and taker (market) fill rates. A symbol's `halfSpreadBps` and `impactCoeff` are scaled by realised over base cost only from 30 market fills on, by at most 4x and inside fixed bounds; fees, borrow, minimum notional and depth never move | `learn/fills.jsonl`, `costs/learned.json` (base table plus a `measured` section) |
| evidence | nightly | snapshots `reports/forward/evidence.json` and tracks, per paper book and autopilot, its status, since when, the one before and how often it was ok in the last 30 reports | `learn/evidence_history.jsonl`, `reports/learn/evidence.json` |
| sweep | every 28 days | re-runs the strategy-family sweep on fresh data in `learn/sweep/<date>`; publishes its reports and run caches to `PYTHIA_AGENT_OUT` only if every pick is there with finite numbers and no fewer variants are counted (the old files are kept in `models/registry/families_sweep/previous/`); lists every gate that flipped. A pick that newly passes is flagged for the owner's review | `reports/learn/gates.json` |
| vol | Sundays | retrains the volatility model as a challenger (`lab.experiments.vol --challenger`) | `models/registry/vol_1h/` |
| m2 | every 28 days | retrains M2 v2 as a challenger (`lab.experiments.picks --perp-features --challenger`) | `models/registry/picks_7d/` |
| digest | nightly | what changed, what was promoted or rejected and why, each autopilot's P&L today and since start against BTC over the same windows | `reports/learn/latest.md`, `latest.json`, dated copies |

**Champion and challenger.** A challenger first has to pass its own gate (the
volatility model: better than HAR, significant, not worse in the last four
quarters; M2: walk-forward rank-IC positive with t of at least 2). Then both
are scored on the rows the champion never saw (after its training end plus the
label horizon): the champion with its own model file, the challenger with the
walk-forward predictions behind its out-of-sample numbers. It replaces the
champion only if it wins by a margin (1 % lower QLIKE, 0.005 higher rank-IC) on
a window of at least 7 days (vol) or 14 days (M2); otherwise the champion
stays. A promotion is copied to `models/<name>/<version>/`, a name that sorts
after the running one, so the engine switches to it on its next hourly check.
Every decision, promoted or not, is a line in
`models/registry/<name>/decisions.jsonl`; `champion.json` says which version is
in force and since when. Without a champion, a challenger that passes its gate
is promoted.

**What it can never do** (`lab/ops/guard.py`, tested): write anywhere but its
own folders, the learned cost file, the model registry and the published model
folders (never the engine's state, settings, keys or the paper books); call the
engine for anything but `GET /api/state`; change a fee, a venue default or a
symbol the base table does not list. Live settings, arming live, moving money
and risk limits live in the engine's state and settings, which the loop only
reads, so it cannot change them. The engine's own auto pick keeps reading the
forward report's `evidence.json` as before.

Install once: the base cost table the loop scales from (copy again whenever
`config/costs.json` changes in the repo), then the cron line. The weekly
retrain moves into the loop, so its old cron line goes.

```bash
install -D -m 644 config/costs.json /srv/pythia-data/costs/base.json
```

```bash
rm -f /etc/cron.d/pythia-retrain
```

`/etc/cron.d/pythia-learn` (host network to read the autopilot engine on
127.0.0.1:8788; `PYTHIA_AGENT_OUT` the same folder the paper-families job uses):

```cron
# Pythia: nightly learning loop. Updates evidence, costs and models within fixed bounds; never touches live settings or money.
30 6 * * * root docker run --rm --network host --cpus 4 --memory 8g -v /srv/pythia-data:/data -v /opt/pythia-lab:/app -e PYTHIA_AGENT_OUT=/data/lab-cache pythia-lab python -m lab.ops.learn >> /var/log/pythia-learn.log 2>&1
```

Run a step now, or leave the heavy ones out:

```bash
docker run --rm --network host --cpus 4 --memory 8g -v /srv/pythia-data:/data -v /opt/pythia-lab:/app -e PYTHIA_AGENT_OUT=/data/lab-cache pythia-lab python -m lab.ops.learn --force vol
```

```bash
docker run --rm --network host --memory 2g -v /srv/pythia-data:/data -v /opt/pythia-lab:/app pythia-lab python -m lab.ops.learn --no-train
```

Both engines already mount the reports read-only, so the Lab page of either
shows the digest as "What the system learned last night". The learned costs
are used only if the operator opts in: add
`-e PYTHIA_COSTS_FILE=/data/costs/learned.json -v /srv/pythia-data/costs:/data/costs:ro`
to the autopilot engine's `docker run` and recreate the container (the cost
file is read at start). Until a symbol has 30 demo market fills the learned
file equals the base table for it.

## Market data in the engine

The engine's crypto quotes, candles and books come from `pythia_core::feeds`,
with a priority list of public venues per kind:

| Kind | Sources, best first | Fails over when |
|---|---|---|
| quotes | Kraken stream, Kraken, Binance, Coinbase, Bybit, OKX | 10 s of stream silence, 25 s without a polled quote, or two failed polls |
| candles (5 min) | Kraken, Binance, Coinbase, Bybit, OKX | 150 s without a refresh, or two failed polls |
| books (top 20) | the executing exchange only (Binance also via its data mirror) | 60 s; past that fills use the calibrated costs |

A market returns to a better source once it has delivered for a minute
without a gap. A quote more than 5 % from every other venue's recent price is
refused and never becomes the mark; stops and trims wait while a price is older
than the risk limit (30 s). The health check's "market data" line is red when
quotes or candles are stale at the moment it runs. With `PYTHIA_WEBHOOK_URL`
set, the engine also posts once when data has been stale for 5 minutes and once
when it recovers.

Knobs, all optional, in the server's environment: `PYTHIA_FEED_QUOTES` and
`PYTHIA_FEED_CANDLES` (comma lists of `kraken-ws,kraken,binance,coinbase,bybit,okx`),
`PYTHIA_FEED_STREAM=0`, `PYTHIA_FEED_STALE_SEC`, `PYTHIA_FEED_RECOVER_SEC`,
`PYTHIA_FEED_MAX_DEVIATION_PCT`, `PYTHIA_FEED_ALERT_MIN`.

## Alerts and the daily digest

One webhook (Discord or Slack) gets three things; the full list and the
behaviour are in `docs/ALERTS.md`:

- the engine's operator alerts, as they happen: autopilot started, stopped,
  stop rule or floor hit, kill switch, daily loss brake, orders refused again
  and again, reconcile mismatch, market data stale for more than 10 minutes,
  model drift
- the daily digest after the learning loop: each running autopilot's equity
  and P&L today and since start against BTC, trades and fees today, the
  forward test per book, anything red in the health check
- the health alarm: `system.json` not ok for two runs in a row, posted once,
  and once when green again

Nothing is posted until the webhook is set. Keep it in one root-only env file
on the server, outside the repo and outside every log:

```bash
install -d -m 700 /etc/pythia
install -m 600 /dev/null /etc/pythia/alerts.env
cat > /etc/pythia/alerts.env <<'ENV'
PYTHIA_ALERT_WEBHOOK=<your webhook URL>
PYTHIA_ALERT_FORMAT=discord
ENV
```

`PYTHIA_ALERT_FORMAT=slack` for a Slack incoming webhook. For Telegram,
leave the webhook out and set `PYTHIA_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` (from BotFather)
and `PYTHIA_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` (the chat the bot writes to; send the bot
any message, then read the id from its `getUpdates`). Optional:
`PYTHIA_ALERT_PREFIX` (default `Pythia`), and for the engine
`PYTHIA_ALERT_REJECTS` (3), `PYTHIA_ALERT_DEDUP_MIN` (30),
`PYTHIA_ALERT_MAX_PER_HOUR` (20).

**Engine.** Add `--env-file /etc/pythia/alerts.env` to the `docker run` of the
engine that runs the autopilots (and of the lab engine, if its alerts are
wanted too, with a different `PYTHIA_ALERT_PREFIX` via `-e`) and recreate the
container. The log says `operator alerts on (Discord format)` at start.

**Daily digest.** It runs right after the learning loop, in the same cron
line, so it always reads tonight's digest. `/etc/cron.d/pythia-learn` becomes:

```cron
# Pythia: nightly learning loop, then the daily digest to the operator's webhook. Never touches live settings or money.
30 6 * * * root docker run --rm --network host --cpus 4 --memory 8g -v /srv/pythia-data:/data -v /opt/pythia-lab:/app -e PYTHIA_AGENT_OUT=/data/lab-cache pythia-lab python -m lab.ops.learn >> /var/log/pythia-learn.log 2>&1; docker run --rm --memory 512m --env-file /etc/pythia/alerts.env -v /srv/pythia-data:/data -v /opt/pythia-lab:/app pythia-lab python -m lab.ops.notify >> /var/log/pythia-notify.log 2>&1
```

See it without posting:

```bash
docker run --rm -v /srv/pythia-data:/data -v /opt/pythia-lab:/app pythia-lab python -m lab.ops.notify --dry-run
```

**Health alarm.** `system_health.sh` runs `/opt/pythia-ops/notify.py --health`
after each check when that file and `/etc/pythia/alerts.env` exist
(`PYTHIA_NOTIFY_PY` and `PYTHIA_ALERT_ENV` move them). It needs only
`python3` on the host. Install with the health script:

```bash
install -m 755 research/ops/system_health.sh /opt/pythia-ops/system_health.sh
install -m 644 research/lab/lab/ops/notify.py /opt/pythia-ops/notify.py
```

The cron line of the health check stays as it is.

**Digest on demand.** `POST /api/alerts/digest` on the engine writes
`reports/notify/request.json`; this cron line sends the digest within five
minutes, with the same `notify.py` the health alarm uses (stdlib only, no
container start). Without a request it does nothing. `/etc/cron.d/pythia-notify-pending`:

```cron
# Pythia: a digest asked for through the engine API, if any. Posts nothing otherwise.
*/5 * * * * root set -a; . /etc/pythia/alerts.env; PYTHIA_DATA=/srv/pythia-data python3 /opt/pythia-ops/notify.py --pending >> /var/log/pythia-notify.log 2>&1
```

The engine that serves the API needs the same folder: add
`-v /srv/pythia-data/reports/notify:/data/reports/notify -e PYTHIA_DATA=/data`
to its `docker run` (see `docs/ALERTS.md`, section HTTP API).

## Trending watcher

`lab.ops.trending` looks every 15 minutes at what the crowd is chasing and
never trades: DexScreener's top boosted tokens and latest token profiles (with
each token's most liquid pair and risk flags: thin liquidity, a pair under 3
days old, FDV over 50x liquidity, volume over 20x liquidity, few sells), the
24h tickers of every Binance USDT pair (top gainers) and, for the coins Alpaca
lists, 24h quote volume and trade count against their 28-day median.

- Every run writes one parquet file to the data lake,
  `/srv/pythia-data/trending/snapshots/date=<day>/<HHMMSS>.parquet` (one row
  per item, `kind` alpaca, gainer, market_surge or dex; read a range with
  `pl.read_parquet(".../trending/snapshots/**/*.parquet", hive_partitioning=True)`),
  and rewrites `reports/trending/latest.json` (title, updatedMs, status,
  headline, items, then the full snapshot).
- Rate limits: 3 to at most about 10 DexScreener calls (boosts, profiles,
  one pair call per chain, at most 5 search fallbacks) and 1 Binance ticker
  call per run;
  the Alpaca coins' 28-day klines are fetched once per UTC day (32 calls at
  weight 2) and cached in `trending/state.json`. Requests are spaced 250 ms
  per host, and a 429 or 418 stops calls to that host for the rest of the run.
- A strong surge on a coin Alpaca lists (volume 3x its 28-day median and up
  8 % in 24 h, or 2x and up 20 %) is posted at once, at most once per coin per
  20 hours, as "watch only".
- At the first run from 08:00 UTC a short digest goes out: the Alpaca coins'
  volume ratios, Binance's top gainers and volume surges, and the on-chain
  hype, labelled high risk and read-only. On-chain tokens are not on Alpaca;
  nothing here trades on a DEX or touches a wallet.

It posts through the same settings as the digest (`/etc/pythia/alerts.env`,
Telegram or webhook). `PYTHIA_ALPACA_COINS` (comma separated bases) overrides
the list of coins Alpaca lists. `/etc/cron.d/pythia-trending`:

```cron
# Pythia: trending watcher. Public market data only; posts surge alerts and a daily watchlist; never trades.
*/15 * * * * root docker run --rm --memory 512m --env-file /etc/pythia/alerts.env -v /srv/pythia-data:/data -v /opt/pythia-lab:/app -e PYTHIA_AGENT_OUT=/data/lab-cache pythia-lab python -m lab.ops.trending >> /var/log/pythia-trending.log 2>&1
```

See it without posting or writing:

```bash
docker run --rm -v /srv/pythia-data:/data -v /opt/pythia-lab:/app pythia-lab python -m lab.ops.trending --dry-run
```

The health check marks it red when `reports/trending/latest.json` is older
than 45 minutes.
